I started off of my career at Accenture as transaction processing new associate and then got promoted after four years to platform experience associate. In my second job, i was a community content management specialist at Businesstrends doing content moderation for TikTok community.</p>

        <h3>Stocks, Crypto and Forex Trading</h3>
        <p>I started learning the fundamentals of trading during early pandemic days. At first I just used copytrading features in etoro, meaning, I'm just copying the portfolio of a professional trader. After I became confident with my skills, I just trade with my own and became a daytrader or sometimes a scalper. But as the crypto turns into bearish market, right now, i'm just a hodler.</p>
